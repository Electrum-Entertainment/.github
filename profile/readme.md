# Electrum Entertainment
Hi, Lead Developer and owner, SpunBlue here. Electrum Entertainment is an indie game studio run by two people as a hobby. We plan to make fun, and for now, free games for everyone to play! including your dog! ... Kidding!

## Our Games
While we haven't released any yet, you can find them all on [itch.io](https://spunblue.itch.io/)!

## Planned Projects
ğŸ¤«ğŸ¤«ğŸ¤« We don't want to leak our hard work ğŸ¤«ğŸ¤«ğŸ¤«

## Copyright
If we end up accidentally screwing up by mistakenly using copyrighted material, there is no need to make a legal threat! I'm just a teenager making games on the internet, anyways. Just let me know and I'll fix it as soon as possible.
